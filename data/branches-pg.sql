<p>The Countee Cullen Branch gives Harlem residents of all ages access to library services delivered in a friendly and effective manner, which will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>enable them to find, evaluate and use information effectively</li>
    <li>provide the materials, programs and services needed to meet their informational and recreational needs</li>
    <li>provide information related to services offered by community agencies and organizations</li>
    <li>enable them to explore the rich Harlem culture and history</li>
</ul>
<p>The Countee Cullen Branch opened on January 14, 1905, as the 135th Street Branch, in a building designed by McKim, Mead and White with funds given by Andrew Carnegie. (The original building is now part of The New York Public Library''s Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.) In 1941, having outgrown its quarters, the library moved to a new building at its present location designed by Louis Allen Abramson. Ten years later the library was renamed for poet and teacher Countee Cullen (1903-1946), an important figure of the Harlem Renaissance and the library''s friend and neighbor. The library occupies the former site of the mansion of A''lelia Walker, daughter of the beauty products tycoon whose home became a gathering place for artists and writers during the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s. The library was renovated in 1990 and is wheelchair accessible.</p>', '2124912070', NULL, NULL, 'countee_cullen@nypl.org', NULL, NULL, '2008-08-04 14:26:41 -0400', '2012-05-08 13:47:41 -0400', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

<p>&quot;The atmosphere in which literature and knowledge are dispensed is part of a cultural package. Today it is the fashion to offer a kind of statistical, book-counting culture in visually illiterate surroundings. At Old Jeff there is also the literature of architecture: cut stone faces and flowers, spiral stairs, soaring stained glass windows, the feeling, form and sensibility of another age. This, too, is the record of civilization.&quot; -- Ada Louise Huxtable, Architecture critic. The New York Times November 28, 1967.</p>
<p>Originally a courthouse, the Jefferson Market Library has served the Greenwich Village community for over forty years. The building, a New York City landmark, was designed by architects Frederick Clark Withers and Calvert Vaux (who also assisted in the design of Central Park) in a Victorian Gothic style. It was erected (along with an adjacent prison and market) during the years 1875-1877 and cost the city almost $360,000.</p>
<p>[img_assist|nid=135291|title=|desc=|link=none|align=center|width=300|height=225]</p>
<p>What the city got for its money, in addition to an architectural gem (it was voted one of the ten most beautiful buildings in America by a poll of architects in the 1880s) was a civil court (on the second floor, where the Adult Reading Room is now) and a police court (now the first-floor Children''s Room). The beautiful brick-arched basement (now the Reference Room) was used as a holding area for prisoners on their way to jail or trial.</p>
<p>Scattered about the building were offices and chambers, and looming above it all was - and is - the tower. A hundred feet above the ground, the firewatcher''s balcony once commanded an uninterrupted view of Greenwich Village. The bell which summoned volunteer firemen still hangs in the tower.</p>
<p>The courthouse was briefly the center of national attention in 1906, when Harry K. Thaw was tried here for the murder of architect Stanford White (the infamous Girl in the Red Velvet Swing case). White''s firm, McKim, Mead and White, had, coincidentally, designed 11 branch library buildings for The New York Public Library.</p>
<p>White''s affair with chorus girl/model Evelyn Nesbit before her marriage to Thaw was the motive in this crime of passion. Thaw was eventually judged to be &quot;insane&quot; and was sent to an asylum until his release in 1915. This story was later immortalized by E.L. Doctorow in his book Ragtime.</p>
<p>[img_assist|nid=100885|title=|desc=|link=none|align=center|width=300|height=199]&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier, in 1896, Stephen Crane, author of The Red Badge of Courage, testified in the courthouse on behalf of a woman he felt was unjustly arrested for prostitution. Crane related that he was &quot;studying human nature&quot; in the dicey Tenderloin area of the city when the alleged solicitation occurred. Front page headlines the next day praised Crane''s &quot;chivalry and courage&quot; for speaking out on behalf of the wrongly accused woman.</p>
<p>In 1909, The Triangle Shirtwaist Company, on Washington Place, one block East of Washington Square in the Asch Building, was notorious for its tough labor policies: low wages, long hours, and annoying rules, which included a prohibition on speaking to one''s neighbor at the workbench and a penalty of being sent home and losing half a day''s pay for taking more time for a toilet break than the floor supervisor felt was necessary.</p>
<p>The workers, in alliance with middle-class sympathizers, demonstrated and went on strike. The Triangle''s owners struck back aggressively. Pickets were verbally and physically harassed by hired thugs and the police, and dozens of strikers were arrested. To add insult to the injury of incarceration and fines, the arrested women were taken to Jefferson Market Courthouse and tried in Night Court, a tactic meant to intimidate strikers through association with the prostitutes whose cases usually filled the court''s dockets by that time. &quot;No nice girls go there,&quot; one arrested shirtwaist maker asserted. These intimidation tactics did not succeed. The striking women''s spirits were not broken and great strides were achieved in their working conditions. Unfortunately, though, not enough changed for the better. The factory, notoriously, was the site of a tragic fire in 1911. 125 garment workers, most very young girls, died in the fire or were killed jumping from the high windows to the pavement below.</p>
<p>[img_assist|nid=135294|title=|desc=|link=none|align=center|width=254|height=300]</p>
<p>By 1927 the courts were used solely for the trials of women, and in 1929 the market and co-ed prison were torn down and replaced by the Women''s House of Detention, probably the only Art Deco prison in the world. Mae West was tried here soon after on obscenity charges when her Broadway play Sex became a target of the Society for the Suppression of Vice. West received a $500 fine, one day next door in the Women''s House of Detention and nine days at the workhouse on Welfare Island (now Roosevelt Island). The House of Detention was razed in 1973 and replaced by a lovely <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jeffersonmarketgarden.org/">community garden.</a></p>
<p>By 1945, through redistricting, court was no longer held at Jefferson Market, and the building was taken over by various agencies including the Police Academy, which is rumored to have used it for riot training. This group departed in 1958, leaving the courthouse empty.</p>
<p>By 1959, the building had become home only to pigeons and rats and was considered such an architectural eyesore the city planned to knock it down and erect an apartment building. But Village community members, led by Margot Gayle and Philip Wittenberg, and including Lewis Mumford, E.E. Cummings (who lived across the street in Patchin Place) and actor Maurice Evans, rallied to save the building from the wrecking ball. In 1961, Mayor Robert F. Wagner announced that it would be preserved and converted into a public library. The task of converting the old courthouse to a modern library was undertaken by architect Giorgio Cavaglieri, who also adapted the Astor Library into the Public Theatre on Lafayette Street.</p>
<p>Construction began in 1965 and the library opened for business in 1967. Among the first of its visitors was the poet Marianne Moore, who had at one time worked for the Hudson Park Branch Library. She found the renovation very pleasing indeed. Many since have come to share her feeling, knowing that a library is an essential space, allowing one to contemplate privately in public, among a world of ideas.</p>
<p><strong>The New York Collection</strong></p>
<p>Since its opening in 1967, The Jefferson Market Regional Library has been collecting interesting, and sometimes rare, books on the history of New York City - and particularly Greenwich Village.

The Branch was a gift of Oswald Ottendorfer, owner of the New-Yorker Staats-Zeitung.

Ottendorfer wished to provide this community with books to cultivate their minds and assist assimilation into American culture. Half of the 8,000 original books were in German with the other half in English. In the same tradition, the branch continues to reflect its community and remains a vital educational and cultural resource for the East Village today. <br />

The building, which is a designated New York City landmark, has been completely renovated through the Library''s Adopt-A-Branch program, through which private donors join public funders to restore branch libraries. While the original Ottendorfer Branch was designed as a bilingual library to serve the German community, the restored library can now better serve its multilingual community and provide an increased level of accessibility to all people. Highlights include restored, repointed, and cleaned fa&ccedil;ade, an elevator, air-conditioning system, spacious reading area, new computer lab workstations, and children''s floor with story hour room.</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>The Fordham Library Center of The New York Public Library opened to the public in 1923. Because of the need for expanded reference services for the borough, the Bronx Reference Center was added to the branch in 1931. By the 1950s the library had become overcrowded due to population growth in the area and the success of the Bronx Reference Center. The original building was renovated, and the new and expanded Fordham reopened in 1956. The Fordham Library Center closed its doors in November 2005 to pave the way for the bigger and more beautiful Bronx Library Center, which opened January 17, 2006.</p>

<div>New Dorp is one of the busiest branches on Staten Island. The New Dorp Community Library was established by local residents in 1907.

In 2000, an extensive renovation was completed including a redesigned exterior and remodeled interior.&nbsp;</div>

<p>The Milstein Division bears the responsibility for maintaining the excellence of a body of materials that has traditionally been one of the strengths of The Research Libraries. The Astor Library''s holdings of United States history on the national, state and local level were enriched by the acquisition of the George Bancroft Collection, purchased by the Lenox Library. Later significant additions were the Ford, Emmet and Myers Collections. Complementary holdings in the <a href="/locations/tid/36/445">Rare Books</a> and <a href="http://new.nypl.org/locations/schwarzman/manuscripts-division">Manuscripts &amp; Archives Division</a>, the <a href="/locations/tid/36/446">Print Room</a> and other divisions of The Research Libraries enhance the resources of The Irma and Paul Milstein Division of United States History, Local History and Genealogy.</p>
<p>As one of the nation''s largest publicly accessible and non-membership genealogical collections, the Milstein Division is a national resource. Cited in most family history handbooks, the Milstein Division is a mecca to researchers from throughout the United States. Unlike many other genealogical and local history collections, the Milstein Division acquires materials beyond the local region. Holdings in United States town, city, county and state histories are national in scope. Genealogical materials are international in scope, including foreign language materials in Roman alphabets.</p>
<p>The Milstein Division''s book and serial collections are supplemented by materials in other formats. Visual resources include photographic and negative collections, primarily of New York City views, and over 100,000 postcards documenting United States local views. A local history ephemera collection of pamphlets, leaflets, etc., provides primary study materials for the cultural, social, and religious history of the United States. The Milstein Division also collects political campaign ephemera, including broadsides, pamphlets, and candidate position papers. Vertical files and genealogical charts further enhance the holdings of The Irma and Paul Milstein Division of United States History, Local History and Genealogy.</p>

<p>Here, patrons can read or study at long oak tables lit by elegant bronze lamps, beneath fifty-two foot tall ceilings decorated by dramatic murals of vibrant skies and billowing clouds. Since the General Research Division&rsquo;s opening day on May 23, 1911, vast numbers of people have entered the main reading room. Literary figures such as Norman Mailer, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Elizabeth Bishop, E. L. Doctorow, and Alfred Kazin have cited the division as a major resource for their work. In one of his memoirs, <em>New York Jew</em>, Kazin described his youthful impression of the reading room: &ldquo;There was something about the . . . light falling through the great tall windows, the sun burning smooth the tops of the golden tables as if they had been freshly painted&mdash;that made me restless with the need to grab up every book, press into every single mind right there on the open shelves.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Registration</h2>
<p>The Orchestra Collection lends materials to organizations, not individuals.

    <li>A letter, on the organization''s stationery, granting specific orchestra members permission to borrow material from the Orchestra Collection on their behalf.</li>
    <li>A completed <a href="http://www.nypl.org/sites/default/files/orchform2012.pdf">registration form</a> (PDF).</li>
    <li>A check for the appropriate amount (as per the fee schedule on the registration form) made out to &quot;NYPL Orchestra Collection.&quot;&nbsp; Cash is also acceptable, but be sure to bring exact change, and to ask for a receipt.</li>

<p>The Jerome Robbins Dance Division of The New York Public Library is the largest and most comprehensive archive in the world devoted to the documentation of dance. Chronicling the art of dance in all its manifestations - ballet, ethnic, modern, social, and folk - the division is much more than a library in the usual sense of the word. It is part museum, part film production center, and part consulting service to the professional dance community. It preserves the history of dance by gathering diverse written, visual, and aural resources, and it works to ensure the art form''s continuity through an active documentation program.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>Founded in 1944 as a separate division of The New York Public Library, the Dance Division is used regularly by choreographers, dancers, critics, historians, journalists, publicists, filmmakers, graphic artists, students, and the general public. Working with the division''s vast resources, a user can reconstruct an Elizabethan court dance, a 19th-century Italian tarantella, or a 20th-century Ceylonese devil dance; determine what makeup Nijinsky wore in <em>Scheherazade</em>; learn the problems Picasso faced in working on the ballet <em>Parade</em> from letters in his own hand; or compare the modern dance styles of Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, and Doris Humphrey.</p>
<p>While the division contains more than 42,000 reference books about dance, these account for only 3 percent of its vast holdings. Other resources available for study free of charge include:</p>
<h2>Films and Videotapes</h2>
<p>The thousands of films and videotapes in the Jerome Robbins Archive of the Recorded Moving Image preserve the ephemeral art of dance. Material ranges from the earliest Edison reels to the latest television broadcasts; from ethnic dances to ballets by Balanchine; from Broadway musicals to dance therapy and notation.</p>
<h2>Audio Recordings</h2>
<p>Audio&nbsp;interviews, which can often be more informative than edited and published memoirs, bring to life the personalities and forces that shape the course of dance history.</p>
<h2>Clipping and Program Files</h2>
<p>Articles culled from hundreds of American and foreign newspapers and arranged under easily accessible subject headings create thousands of clipping files. These, with program files, substantially simplify the process of primary-source research.</p>
<h2>Iconography</h2>
<p>Prints, original designs, posters, and photographs &ndash; from Mary Wigman''s design for her own production of <em>Le Sacre du Printemps</em>, to renderings by artists such as de Chirico, Bakst, Chagall, and Noguchi -- provide rich insights into details of costume and set design, as well as performance style.</p>
<h2>Manuscripts and Memorabilia</h2>
<p>More than 1 million manuscript items, ranging from choreographic notes and diaries to contracts and financial records of major companies, provide vivid details about the history of dance. Such rarities as an early dance treatise by the Italian-Jewish dancing master Giorgio Ebreo and Madame Pompadour''s personal copy of libretti for divertissements performed at Versailles for Louis XV exemplify the division''s rich resources.</p>', '2128701657', NULL, NULL, 'dance@nypl.org', NULL, NULL, '2009-01-08 16:02:34 -0500', '2012-10-17 17:49:16 -0400', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

<!--break-->
<p>Particularly noteworthy is the American Music Collection, with its own curator. From the first edition of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; to Native American songs to extensive manuscript collections of American composers such as Charles Tomlinson Griffes, Henry Cowell, John Cage, and Louis Moreau Gottschalk, the division has made the documentation of American classical and popular music a major priority. Collection efforts bring to the division a copy of almost every piece of classical and popular music published in the United States each year. Through special arrangements with leading American music publishers, the division also acquires numerous rental scores &ndash; documents that would otherwise be inaccessible for study.</p>
<p>The Music Division traces its origins to 1888, when the Lenox Library (which combined with the Astor Library and the Tilden Trust in 1895 to form The New York Public Library) acquired the extraordinary music library of financier Joseph Drexel &ndash; a collection of 6,000 volumes, containing rare 15th- through 19th-century music. Throughout the 20th century the division has built on this core material, at the same time developing a comprehensive collection of basic bibliographies, historical editions, and complete works that supports general research in the field.</p>
<p>A vital center for music scholars and students, the Music Division also serves the needs of a broad professional constituency: singers and instrumentalists in search of unusual music, writers preparing program notes for concerts and recordings, lawyers searching copyrights, television producers and book publishers in need of illustrative material, and sociologists studying popular culture. Resources &ndash; available for study free of charge &ndash; include:</p>
<h2>Printed Books, Scores, and Periodicals</h2>
<p>Extensive biographical, historical, and interpretive material is provided through theoretical treatises, contemporary reference works, and subscriptions to over 800 English and foreign-language periodicals. The division houses numerous rare editions of books and scores, as well as modern editions of music from countries throughout the world.</p>
<h2><strong>Please note that over 100,000 of our scores do not appear in the online Catalog. &nbsp;Please contact the division for further information.</strong></h2>
<h2>Clippings and Programs</h2>
<p>Articles culled from American and foreign newspapers and arranged under easily accessible personal names and subject headings create clipping files that substantially simplify the process of research. Extensive program files provide details about repertory, performers, and producing organizations.</p>
<h2>Iconography</h2>
<p>Visual materials, including over 100,000 photographs, 5,000 set and costume designs for opera, and the Joseph Muller Collection of 6,000 fine prints of musicians'' portraits from the 15th through the mid-20th centuries, provide rich documentation for all aspects of music, past and present.</p>
<h2>Archival Collections</h2>
<p>Individual and corporate archival collections document all aspects of the art, from the compositional process to the dynamics of the music business. Among the musicians and organizations represented are Marcella Sembrich, Arturo Toscanini, Town Hall, the New Music Society, and Composers Forum.</p>
<h2>Autograph Music Manuscripts</h2>
<p>Autograph music manuscripts help illuminate artistic intent and the creative process. The Music Division holds thousands of composers&rsquo; autographs from the 18th through the 20th centuries. This collection is supplemented by the Toscanini Memorial Archives, which contains microfilm copies of autograph music manuscripts housed in libraries throughout the world. Prominently represented in both collections are works of J.S. Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Handel, Haydn, Liszt, Mahler, Mozart, Rossini, Wagner, and Britten.</p>
<h2>Sheet Music</h2>
<p>Close to 500,000 pieces of sheet music, including an extensive collection of American popular songs, demonstrate trends in popular taste as well as the social, political, cultural, and historical issues of the time.</p>
<h2>Electronic Resources</h2>
<p>The Library provides access to many music-specific online databases, including <em>Grove Music Online</em>, <em>RILM Abstracts of Music Literature</em>, and the <em>Index to Printed Music</em>. The Library also subscribes to a growing number of electronic journals. Some of these databases and ejournals may be accessed from outside the Library by NYPL cardholders, while others are available onsite only.</p>', '2128701650', NULL, NULL, 'musicdiv@nypl.org', NULL, NULL, '2009-01-08 16:05:07 -0500', '2011-11-14 09:46:01 -0500', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

A vital research facility for performers,       musicians, scholars, critics, and the recording industry, the collection       also plays a leadership role in developing technology that allows for the       transfer of sound from obsolete to accessible formats.

<p>The scope of the collection draws users from many disciplines: critics       comparing multiple recordings of a musical selection, opera singers preparing       unfamiliar roles, instrumentalists studying a new piece before first rehearsal,       actors preparing for auditions by studying dialect tapes or musical theatre       recordings, filmmakers in search of topical songs for soundtracks, and performing       groups in search of new repertory. Rare items such as pre-Glasnost underground       videos of Russian rock groups, Fiorello La Guardia''s Talks to the People       radio broadcasts, and recordings of famed black vaudevillian Bert Williams       draw researchers and historians from many fields.</p>
<p>The Archives contains approximately 700,000 recordings and more than 100,000       printed items. Resources&mdash;available for study free of charge&mdash;include:</p>

<p>Virtually every format developed to record sound&mdash;wax cylinders, acetate       and aluminum discs, magnetic wire recordings, 78rpm recordings, audiocassettes,       compact discs, digital audiotape&mdash;can be found in the Archives. Rarities       include the Mapleson Cylinders, recorded at the Metropolitan Opera House       in 1901-3 with such legendary singers as the De Reszke brothers, Milka Ternina,       and Lillian Nordica; Irving Berlin singing his own songs; and thousands       of limited-edition and private-issue recordings ranging from Kirsten Flagstad''s       Metropolitan Opera debut to world premieres of major operas and symphonic       works.</p>
<h2>Recorded Literature and Speech</h2>
<p>Readings by major poets, novelists, and essayists and pronouncements by       world leaders bring to life the power, poetry, and nuance of the spoken       word. Recordings range from the speeches of John F. Kennedy to private recordings       of Tennessee Williams reading from his own works.</p>
<h2>Moving Images</h2>
<p>Materials that complement those of the other research divisions&mdash;dance,       music, and theatre&mdash;of The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts       can be found in the Archives'' collection of videotapes and videodiscs. Representative       items include opera and music performances, rock videos, master classes,       and public television broadcasts.</p>
<h2>Printed Materials</h2>
<p>Printed materials cover the entire field of sound recording&mdash;artistic,       technological, and economic&mdash;from the 1890s to the present.

<p>Preservation is achieved through program areas including: Collections Care; Conservation Treatment; Field Services; Registrar&rsquo;s Office for Exhibitions, Loans and Collections; Audio Preservation; Moving Image Preservation; Microfilming; and an emerging collaborative digital preservation program. <br />
<br />
In 2008, as part of a major Library reorganization that unified the Research and Branch Libraries, the Barbara Goldsmith Preservation Division expanded from a research library-centered program to an institution-wide program to preserve the Library&rsquo;s permanent assets in all formats housed in more than ninety-one buildings in Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island, and the ReCAP high-density storage facility in New Jersey. <br />
<br />
It is the Library&rsquo;s responsibility to preserve its vast, incomparable collections through advanced practice and techniques and to act as a keeper of public record. In Fiscal Year 2008, more than 156,000 items were preserved, including books, photographs, prints, and videos, through conservation treatment, repair, stabilization, protective housing, binding, microfilming, and reprint acquisition. In addition, 884 hours of recorded sound media, 7,138 feet of motion picture film, and 1,796 hours of videotape media were preserved.</p>
<p><br />
Additionally, the library is a founding participant in the National Digital Newspaper Program, a collaborative effort financed and administered by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Library of Congress. Through this exciting project, the library is digitizing its microfilm collection of historical New York newspapers. (Digitized content is available through <a href="http://www.loc.gov/chroniclingamerica/">Chronicling America </a>.)</p>
<p><br />
The collections at The New York Public Library now comprise almost 55 million items in a vast array of formats. Like other cultural institutions with vast holdings and finite resources, the Library makes decisions to most effectively allocate its resources to those items most warranting preservation. We are, of course, continually working to find the resources to expand these activities, and we are always interested in hearing from our readers about their specific concerns, so please do alert a librarian when you find materials that would benefit from attention by the Preservation Division. Additionally, the Division may be reached directly through Preserve@nypl.org.<br />

This makes searches 	    for individual 	    songs (title keyword search) in the catalog, at best, incomplete. To 	    remedy this situation, we have a representative Reference Collection of 	    popular 	    songs (roughly 40,000 titles) accessible on selected PCs in the Music 	    Reading Room. Patrons may search the Song Index by titles, first lines and 	    source 	    (Show, Film, Television). This index is kept current and is heavily used 	    by the public. We also provide a large reference collection of musical 	    comedy full piano-vocal scores and vocal selections.</p>

The Library for the Performing Arts has one of the world&rsquo;s most significant collections of research materials about music, dance, theatre, and recorded sound. A large part of this collection falls under the umbrella of &ldquo;special collections,&rdquo; which means that these materials are rare, unique, very old, and/or fragile and are available for researchers only onsite at the library. These materials can be rare books and manuscripts, photographs, music scores, film, video and audio recordings, scrapbooks, clippings and program files, set models, artwork, and ephemera, as well as archival collections that include published and unpublished materials documenting the life of an individual, the work of a group or company, or a particular subject. Because these materials are special, they require careful handling, security, and storage so that LPA can protect and preserve them for researchers today and in the future. </font></p>

<!--break-->
<h3>Application and Admission</h3>
<p>A signed application for admission should be completed, signed and returned, in person, e-mail, or postal mail, to Jay Barksdale, Study Rooms Liaison, Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, The New York Public Library, 476 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10018. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The physical limitations of the Room preclude admission to as many applicants as qualify.  Such names will be kept on a waiting list and notified as admission becomes feasible.</p>
<p>The assignment may vary, from one week and 9 months.  After nine months of continuous use, each writer must vacate the Room for a minimum period of one month, after which time the writer may re-apply for study space.  The Library reserves the right to cancel a writer''s assignment to the room at any time.</p>
<h3>Access and Use</h3>
<p>Each writer admitted to the Room will be assigned a numbered shelf on which Library materials will be held.  The use of the Room is limited to registered writers.  The Room must be used only for the research project indicated on each writer''s application form.  Individual seating assignments are not made.  The Room must be locked at all times.</p>
<p>Each writer will be issued an electronic keycard, to be returned when the term of assignment ends.</p>
<p>Writers may bring laptops, but they should not be left in the Room.  The Library cannot be responsible at any time for personal property left in the Room.  At the end of the assignment, all personal property must be removed.</p>
<p>No food or drink in any form may be brought into the Room.  Violation of these rules will result in immediate termination from the Room.</p>
<p>The Room will be available whenever the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building is open to the public.</p>
<h3>Requesting and Holding Material in the Study</h3>
<p>Requests for delivery of general research material should be made using blue Wertheim Study call slips, a supply of which is kept in the Room.  They should be taken to the Delivery Desk in the Rose Main Reading Room.  Deliveries are made several times each day and placed on the &quot;Incoming Books&quot; shelves.  Books will be checked out on the writer''s library card, and may be kept for the length of the assigned term.   When a writer finishes with a book, it should be placed on the &quot;Outgoing Books&quot; shelves.  Each book will include the copy of the original call slip.  Books must be kept on the writer''s shelf, and with the duplicate call slip exposed.  If a book held in the Room is requested by another Library user, the book will be removed, and the duplicate call slip left on the shelf.  These books are not automatically returned to the Room; if the writer wishes to continue using the book, a new request should be submitted.</p>
<p>Certain items from the collections may not be available because of value, rarity, fragility, current demand, or other considerations.  Materials from the Special Collections, i.e., Manuscripts, Rare Books, etc., and Current Periodicals must be used in those divisions.</p>
